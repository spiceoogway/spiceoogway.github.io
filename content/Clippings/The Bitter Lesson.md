## The One-Step Trap (in AI Research)

## Rich Sutton

The one-step trap is the common mistake of thinking that all or most of an AI agent’s learned predictions can be one-step ones, with all longer-term predictions generated as needed by iterating the one-step predictions. The most important place where the trap arises is when the one-step predictions constitute a model of the world and of how it evolves over time. It is appealing to think that one can learn just a one-step transition model and then “roll it out” to predict all the longer-term consequences of a way of behaving. The one-step model is thought of as being analogous to physics, or to a realistic simulator.  
  
The appeal of this mistake is that it contains a grain of truth: if all one-step predictions can be made with perfect accuracy, then they can be used to make all longer-term prediction with perfect accuracy. However, if the one-step predictions are not perfectly accurate, then all bets are off. In practice, iterating one-step predictions usually produces poor results. The one-step errors compound and accumulate into large errors in the long-term predictions. In addition, computing long-term predictions from one-step ones is prohibitively computationally complex. In a stochastic world, or for a stochastic policy, the future is not a single trajectory, but a tree of possibilities, each of which must be imagined and weighted by its probability. As a result, the computational complexity of computing a long-term prediction from one-step predictions is exponential in the length of the prediction, and thus generally infeasible.  
  
The bottom line is that one-step models of the world are hopeless, yet extremely appealing, and are widely used in POMDPs, Bayesian analyses, control theory, and in compression theories of AI.  
  
The solution, in my opinion, is to form temporally abstract models of the world using options and GVFs, as in the following references.
